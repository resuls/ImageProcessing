# Digital Imaging

I will be sharing solutions of my assignments on Digital Imaging course in FH Hagenberg.
If you have ever used OpenCV then this might sound familiar to you. What we do
in this class is we implement those algorithms, in other words we create our own
mini Photoshop. I will be sharing my weekly report here as well which will explain
the task and how I solved it.

## Get Started
Inside `src-plugins` folder I will have source files for each lab session.

Run `ij.jar` and you will see these plugins on plugins section of menu.
